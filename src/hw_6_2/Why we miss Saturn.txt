The reason why "Saturn" is missed is because that two references, one of which is stored in the vector during runtime,
the other of which is the one created in the main function, are both pointing to the same memory address.
So when we modify the "Saturn" from outsider reference in the main function,
it will change the object that the reference of the vector is pointing.
As a result, we will miss "Saturn" after setting the new names and other variables to the object, which the two references are stands for
